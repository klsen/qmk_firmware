learn how to use a readme dumbass

my keymap 
make it nice

features:
  base layer:
    split space. space on left, backspace on right
    grave/tilde mixed with esc

  func layer: 
    f1..12 on number row
    media controls on qwerty
    page up/down and home/end on arrow keys
    delete on backspace
    numpad on m,.jkluio and symbols on ;'p[

  rgb layer: 
    change rgb modes on number row
    change hue, sat, brightness on arrow keys and 2 keys on left

  other:
    lights change on caps
    lights change when switching to fn layer
    using normal backspace makes keyboard red bc it's the wrong backspace
    added keycodes for rgb modes that didn't have them ('twinkle', 'alternating')
    can use cmd+shift+esc combo
    wpm lighting mode using the snake animation

planned features:
  macros or something?
  make pics of layouts
  rgb mode where you can select between different plain colors: green, amber, blue, purple, etc.
  format this readme
  back up fork on github

pipe dream:
  use rgb breathing effect on sleep
  some debug mode where the keyboard can teach you which key is which
    or make a pretty graphic of your layout
  per-key lighting hack where a some light blinks when a key is pressed. maybe it's the closest light, but what if it was random
